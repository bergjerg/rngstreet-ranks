        Efficient Hours Played (EHP) is a way of scaling points based on the difficulty or time required to level a skill. It measures the amount of experience needed to represent one hour of gameplay at maximum efficiency for a given skill.
        For example, at level 70 you would need either 56k Agility XP or 250k Firemaking XP to earn 1 EHP. This reflects the relative time investment and difficulty of leveling different skills.
        
        In the clan, 4 EHP gained translates into 1 clan point.

    embed.add_field(
        name=f"{bossing_emoji} EHB (Efficient Hours Bossed - Bossing Points)",
        value="""
        Efficient Hours Bossed (EHB) is a similar concept to EHP, but it applies to bossing. EHB scales based on the difficulty and time required to defeat different bosses. For example, completing a raid may count for more EHB than killing a lower-level boss because of the increased time and effort involved.

        In the clan, 3 EHB earned translates into 1 clan point.
